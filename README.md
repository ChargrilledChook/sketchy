Assignment for The Odin Project to practice and demonstrate DOM manuipulation.

Future updates: add suggested extra features from lesson (different colours, increasing darkness etc)

Improved UI / more interactivity (buttons to toggle colours etc)

v1 begun and completed on 26/4/2020.

Most difficult part was setting up event listeners to toggle colour on individual squares. Was helped by stack overflow, ended up being less complex than I thought.

I think the javascript is reasonably clean for my current skill level. Event delegation could be used to improve performance (eg currently writing big grids crashes the page)
but more important to get around the basics of DOM at this stage.
